I know nothing about hardware, so each device would have its own serial code right?
Assuming it does:
1. Log onto website, create account, specify phone/email, and register device in your account.
2. Lock is then added to database and email/phone number is stored.
3. When lock is unlocked, it sends request to endpoint, updating its location. (we can use this data to accumulate data on bike locations/paths)
4. When lock is broken, hits endpoint, which will alert the user and start showing the devices gps coords and path that it has taken on website
5. When lock is running low on battery, will hit endpoint to alert user

Optionally, could include weather data and time when lock is broken which would allow us to do basic analytics on when and where
locks are more likely to be broken into.
